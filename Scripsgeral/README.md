BIID found: o%2JREfoFxWfdk4i1VOvPQiX96MfpZ7qlZ6kXiGeHbjvJ%3d
```

# Running notify

## CLI

You can use **notify** to receive burp collaborator interaction on your CLI, following command accepts `biid` as input and post all incoming interaction over CLI.

```sh
notify -biid 132456789                                  
```

## Slack notification

The tool accept parameters from a config file located at `$HOME/.config/notify/notify.conf` or either via CLI. 

To run the tool just use the following command.

```sh
â–¶ notify -biid 132456789 -slack -slack-webhook-url https://a.b.c -slack-username test -slack-channel test-channel
```

If you already configured the config file, you can simply run following command and `notify` will start receiving burp collaborator interaction on CLI and sends notification to slack / discord. 

```sh
â–¶ notify
```

## Discord notification

Similarly to slack, in order to use discord

```sh
â–¶ notify -biid 132456789 -discord -discord-webhook-url https://a.b.c -discord-username notify-bot
```

## Telegram notification

Similarly to slack, in order to use discord

```sh
â–¶ notify -biid 132456789 -telegram -telegram-api-key 119489xxxx-:AAF4OV9 -telegram-chat-id 1231434
```

## Using notify with other tools

Notify also supports piping output of any tool and send it over discord/slack channel as notification.

Following command will enumerate subdomains using [SubFinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder) and probe for alive URLs and sends the notifications of alive URLs using [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) to configured discord / slack channel.

```
subfinder -d hackerone.com | httpx | notify
```

<h1 align="left">
  <img src="static/notify-httpx.png" alt="notify-httpx" width="700px"></a>
  <br>
</h1>

Following command will enumerate subdomains using [SubFinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder) and probe alive URLs using [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx), runs [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) templates and send the nuclei results as a notifications to configured discord / slack channel.


```
subfinder -d intigriti.com | httpx | nuclei -t files | notify
```

In similar manner, output (stdout) of any tool can be piped to **notify** for posting data into slack/discord.

- Config file has priority over CLI arguments.
- Telegram notifcation does not support burp collaborator.
